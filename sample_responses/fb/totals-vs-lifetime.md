In the context of the Facebook Graph API, the terms "totals" and "lifetime" refer to different ways of aggregating metrics over time. Here’s a detailed explanation of each:

### Lifetime Metrics

- **Lifetime Metrics** capture data for the entire duration of a post or page's existence. These metrics accumulate from the time the content is published until the present moment or until it is deleted.
- **Usage:** Lifetime metrics are useful for understanding the long-term performance and overall engagement of a post or page.

**Example:**
- **Metric:** `post_engaged_users`
- **Description:** The total number of unique users who have engaged with the post since it was published.

**API Request:**
```shell
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v11.0/{post-id}/insights?metric=post_engaged_users&period=lifetime&access_token={access-token}"
```

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "post_engaged_users",
      "period": "lifetime",
      "values": [
        {
          "value": 150
        }
      ],
      "title": "Lifetime Engaged Users",
      "description": "The number of unique people who engaged with your post through reactions, comments, shares, and clicks."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Totals Metrics

- **Totals Metrics** often refer to the summation of specific metrics over a defined period, like daily, weekly, or monthly intervals. While "totals" is not a specific period like "lifetime," it implies the aggregated sum of certain activities or engagements within a specified time frame.
- **Usage:** Totals metrics are useful for analyzing performance within specific intervals, such as understanding daily engagement patterns or comparing week-over-week performance.

**Example:**
- **Metric:** `post_impressions`
- **Description:** The total number of times the post was displayed on users' screens within a specified period.

**API Request:**
```shell
curl -i -X GET "https://graph.facebook.com/v11.0/{post-id}/insights?metric=post_impressions&period=day&access_token={access-token}"
```

**Sample Response:**
```json
{
  "data": [
    {
      "name": "post_impressions",
      "period": "day",
      "values": [
        {
          "value": 100,
          "end_time": "2024-06-28T07:00:00+0000"
        },
        {
          "value": 150,
          "end_time": "2024-06-29T07:00:00+0000"
        },
        {
          "value": 120,
          "end_time": "2024-06-30T07:00:00+0000"
        }
      ],
      "title": "Daily Total Impressions",
      "description": "Total number of times this post was shown to users per day."
    }
  ]
}
```

### Summary of Differences

- **Scope:**
  - **Lifetime Metrics:** Cover the entire lifespan of the content.
  - **Totals Metrics:** Aggregate data over defined, shorter periods (e.g., daily, weekly, monthly).

- **Usage:**
  - **Lifetime Metrics:** Useful for long-term analysis and overall performance tracking.
  - **Totals Metrics:** Useful for short-term analysis, identifying trends, and making periodic comparisons.

By understanding these differences, you can choose the appropriate metrics to measure and analyze your Facebook content’s performance effectively.
