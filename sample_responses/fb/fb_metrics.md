Certainly! Here are explanations for each of these metrics, which are commonly used in social media and web analytics:

1. **Page Impressions**:
    - This metric represents the total number of times any content from your page or about your page was displayed to users. It includes instances where the content was displayed in someone's news feed, in search results, or through other means.
    - It does not count unique users but rather the total number of times the content is shown.

2. **Page Engaged Users**:
    - This metric measures the number of unique users who interacted with your page. Interactions can include likes, comments, shares, clicks, and other forms of engagement.
    - It provides insight into how many individual users are actively engaging with your page content.

3. **Page Views Total**:
    - This metric indicates the total number of times your page was viewed by users. It includes repeated views by the same users.
    - It's useful for understanding overall page traffic and interest over a given period.

4. **Post Impressions**:
    - This metric refers to the total number of times a specific post from your page was displayed to users. Like page impressions, it counts the number of times the post was shown, regardless of whether it was seen multiple times by the same user.
    - It helps measure the reach of individual posts.

5. **Post Engagements**:
    - This metric tracks the total number of interactions with a specific post. This includes likes, comments, shares, clicks on links or images, and any other form of interaction with the post.
    - It provides a measure of how engaging and effective a specific post is at prompting user interactions.

These metrics are crucial for evaluating the performance of your social media pages and posts, helping you understand reach, user engagement, and overall effectiveness of your content.

Sure! Hereâ€™s an example of how you might get the post engagements data using a GET request with the Facebook Graph API. This example assumes you are querying the data for a specific post on a Facebook page.
